# 👋 Hello, I'm Stanislav Brysin

I'm rebuilding my life from the ground up — after years of political exile, a dramatic escape across the sea, and now a complete professional transformation.

🎯 Today, I'm training to become a **Junior Data Analyst** — learning every day, building real skills, and preparing for opportunities in the Netherlands and beyond.

## 🧭 My story

After publicly speaking out against the Russian government, I spent **five years in Sweden** as an asylum seeker. Despite facing an open criminal case in Russia for political dissent, my application was denied, and I was held in deportation prison for 7 months.

In 2023, I made a life-or-death decision: I bought a small yacht and **escaped Sweden alone by sea**, navigating through Denmark and Germany to the Netherlands, where I finally found safety and hope.

During my time in Sweden, I also **volunteered to help Ukrainian refugees** — offering translation, emotional support, and assistance with job placement and integration.  
That experience strengthened not only my empathy, but also my **communication and coordination skills**.

## 🔁 From survival to development

In 2024, I was living in a refugee camp in the Netherlands, waiting for a decision on my status — and I faced a question:

> *“Do I waste this time… or rebuild from zero?”*

I chose growth.

I made the decision to pursue a **new, meaningful profession** — one that reflects my values of logic, truth, and impact: **Data Analytics**.
